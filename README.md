## Takeaways
- "computer".compareTo ("comparison") will return a value of (int) 'u' - (int) 'a' (21). Since this is a positive result, the parameter ("comparison") is lexicographically first.

- == checks if both objects point to the same memory location whereas .equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.

- == checks memory add. compareTo finds difference. .Equals finds equality
