## Naming_Convention
*source_name_difficulty*
  - **source:** Problems come from LeetCode, HackerRank, and various other mostly online sources. i.e.[LeetCode34](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/) or [hrInPrep](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit?h_l=domains&h_r=hrw&utm_source=hrwCandidateFeedback)
  
  - **name:** custom name will attempt to describe the problem.  Topic wont be mentioned as the problems are sorted by topic. i.e. datBucketProblem
  - **difficulty:** 1-5 range...1 being very hard. The difficulty index is relative during the time attempted. Hard problems will become easier over time.


  - File names starting with "**0_**" are holy files...generally be problem banks. The rules above don't apply.
  - Ignore **.class** files. They are generated from compiling java on VS code




## Takeaways
- Popular ascii refrences :: 'a' = 97 | 'z' = 122 | 'A' = 65 | 'Z' = 90. | '0' = 48 | '9' = 57
- Convert String to ascii :: *int ascii = (int) store[j]*  (Store[i] is char[])
- Convert int to string :: *Integer.toString(int)*
- Convert String to int :: *(int) INTEGER.valueOf(String s)*
- Convert string to char array :: *.toCharArray()*
- Replace or remove elements in string :: *replaceAll("\\s","")* (this ex. rm whitespace)
