# graphs
Problems and notes on sub-topic graphs.


## terms
- **Directed acyclic graph (D.A.G.)** intuitive use topological sort
- **Minimum spanning tree** : connect all vertices with the least amount of total weight. Use Prims or Kruskal's Alg.
- **Complete graph** each vertex is connected to all the other vertices
