## memory level
- In Java main() calls all the methods in the class. The calls are stores in the stack.
- when running each call, we create a heap to store variables
- this all happens in the RAM.
- L1 Cache AKA d-cache or data-cache
- L2 Cache AKA i-cache or instructor-cache
- EXAMPLE: in a for loop l1 stores the i val and l2 stores the "how" for loop works i.e. iterator class?
