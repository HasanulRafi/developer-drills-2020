# Trees
Notes on subtopic trees.

## Basics
- Tree traversal sequence visual. N(print) pos based on seq. Fill in L / R
  + preorder  **N** L R
  + inorder   L **N** R
  + postorder L R **N**
- level order is finding adj vertex from current vertex first. many permutations. can use bfs with parameter as starting node or root.
- DFS : pre/in/post- orders BFS is level order
- whenever hear subtree err to **postorder** nlr bc. you need left and right first
