# Daily Practice
Practice makes perfect. A folder to catalog when I re-do interview problems and concepts.

The four axioms of technical assessment are...
- programming : understand semantics and demonstrated mastery of chosen language
- problem-solving : able to digest, recognize and tackle question w multiple solutions, trade offs, edge case concerns and connect CS concepts like L2 cache
- communication : think out loud, ask questions and build rapport
- verification : after problem solved run down solution w sample input and reiterate edge cases and trade offs

This "daily practice" is to help me improve on problem-solving and programming axioms.
