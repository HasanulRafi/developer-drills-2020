# Dynamic Programming
Problems and notes on sub-topic dynamic programming or DP.

## Common Problems
1. Fibonacci (Classic)
2. Knapsack (Amazon Truck problem)

## Basics
- Always thought that recursion was dope stuff but it isn't
- DP is an optimization for many recursive, brute-force solutions
- DP problems appear as: need to calculate all combinations / work from prev. steps (Recursion) / find minimum path or cost
- DP is to optimize and do less work say if procastination monkey knew how to code
- We optimize by breaking the problem into subproblems and saving past computations so we don't have to redo them
- two ways of approaching DP problems
