## Problem Dump
1. [Wildcard lookup using tries](#wildcard-lookup)

## wildcard-lookup
 - **Problem** There are two parts to this question. The first is a function called setup that takes a list of words. In this function, you have a chance to preprocess the list of words in order to solve and improve the runtime of the second part which is a function called isMember. isMember takes in a string and returns whether or not that string exists in the list of words. isMember may also contain one or more dots (.) which is a wildcard that matches exactly one character of any value in setup at the current index of the string.
- **Clarifying Qs.** ascii or utf? upprcase / lowercase? isSetup called once?
