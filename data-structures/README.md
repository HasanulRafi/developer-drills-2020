## Takeaways
### Collections v Data Structures 
- A data structure is how the data is represented inside the storage in memory. A collection is how it **can** be accessed.
- The Collection interface **(java.util.Collection)** and Map interface **(java.util.Map)** are the two main “root” interfaces of Java collection classes.
