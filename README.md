## Takeaways
- "computer".compareTo ("comparison") will return a value of (int) 'u' - (int) 'a' (21). Since this is a positive result, the parameter ("comparison") is lexicographically first.

- == checks if both objects point to the same memory location whereas .equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.

- == checks memory add. compareTo finds difference. .Equals finds equality

## Naming_convention
*name_source_diffculty*
  - **name:** i.e. datBucketProblem
  - **source:** i.e. [leetcode34](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/) or [hrInPrep](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit?h_l=domains&h_r=hrw&utm_source=hrwCandidateFeedback)
  - **diffculty:** 1-5 range measured at the time...1 being very hard
