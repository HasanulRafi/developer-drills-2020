# Daily Practice
Practice makes perfect. A folder to catalog my daily attempts at re-calling core algorithms such as the iterative dfs tree traversals from memory.

The four axioms of technical assessment are...
- programming : understand semantics and mastery of chosen language
- problem solving : able to digest, recognize and tackle question w multiple solutions, trade offs, edge case concerns and connect CS concepts like L2 cache
- communication : think out loud
- verification : after problem solved run down solution w sample input and reiterate edge cases and trade offs

This "daily practice" is to help me improve my problem solving skills.
