# Developer_Drills
Mastering fundamental data structures and algorithms by solving something daily.

## Game Plan
- Preparing for full-time software engineering interview questions
- Strategy 1 (Mastery) : One topic at a time. i.e. To get good with Anagrams, tackle all Anagram related Qs
- Strategy 2 (Familiar) : Devise a method for the problem, then compare solutions. Code problem when unfamiliar
- Strategy 3 (Motivate) : Knockout as many problems possible to get the ball rolling

## Takeaways
- ![Dope Data-Structure flowchart](/dump/pics/flow-purple.jpg)
- **.Equals()** compares objects | **.compareTo** finds lexicographic difference | **==** checks memory address
- Neat one-liner condition statement **int result = a > b ? x : y;**
- Override is prioritizing local methods over parent methods
- Overload is methods with same names different parameters
- Strings are immutable. Once defined, specific locations in string can't be changed. i.e. "wewr" change the first 'w' to 'K'
- int randomWithRange = (int)(MATH.random()(max - min + 1)) + min
