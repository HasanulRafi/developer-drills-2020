# Developer_Drills
Mastering fundamental data structures and algorithms by solving something daily.

## Breakout
- **What** Prepare for full-time software engineering interview questions
- **How** Familirize with one topic at a time. i.e. To get good at Anagram problems, tackle all Anagram related Q's on Leetcode
- Currently knocking out Leetcode problems. Done so far : 10
- [Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition PDF](/cracking-code.pdf)*

## Takeaways
- [Dope Data-Structure flowchart](/dump/pics/flow-purple.jpg)
- **.Equals()** compares objects | **.compareTo** finds lexicographic difference | **==** checks memory address
- Neat one-liner condition statement **int result = a > b ? x : y;**
- Override is prioritizing local methods over parent methods
- Overload is methods with same names different parameters
- Strings are immutable. Once defined, specific locations in string can't be changed. i.e. "wewr" change the first 'w' to 'K'
- int randomWithRange = (int)(MATH.random()(max - min + 1)) + min
